Switch to a different buffer in the current window by incrementally typing the name.

Usage:

(1) Define a normal key mapping to :IncBufSwitch or leave the default of <C-S>
(2) In normal mode, start typing the name of the buffer you want to switch to.
(3) Press <BS> if make an error
(4) Press <TAB> to find the next matching buffer
(5) Press either <CR> or <ESC> when you are done

For example, if you have the following files in memory:

foo.c, bar.c, baz.c, structs.h

and you are currently editing foo.c.

Example 1: You press <C-S> and type s<CR>.  You are now editing structs.h.
Example 2: You press <C-S> and type b.  Buffer switches to bar.c.  If you press <TAB> baz.c enters the window.

The project I work on has a LOT of files.  It is not uncommon to have 20-30 files in memory at any given time.  I find that this allows me to switch amongst them much faster.

Let me know of any ideas or problems.
